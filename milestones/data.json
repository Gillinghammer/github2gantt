Using a third party tool like Zapier we’re able to detect changes in one of our systems or webhooks and send that data to Webflow to automatically update our CMS and pages. We would like to start by automating the connection between Greenhouse.io (our job board) and the careers page hosted in Webflow. When a new job is published on that platform it would push an update to our Careers page. This will give us ultimate control over the styling and filtering of these jobs.","creator":{"login":"Gillinghammer","id":578328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODMyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/578328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer","html_url":"https://github.com/Gillinghammer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1,"closed_issues":1,"state":"open","created_at":"2020-04-12T03:09:03Z","updated_at":"2020-04-12T07:12:09Z","due_on":"2020-04-15","closed_at":null,"start_on":"2019-09-03"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mapbox/www.mapbox.com-requests/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/mapbox/www.mapbox.com-requests/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mapbox/www.mapbox.com-requests/milestones/2/labels","id":5299715,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTI5OTcxNQ==","number":2,"title":"WWW-02-Migrate Blog to Webflow","description":"At Mapbox we’re obsessed with storytelling, whether it is talking about the company’s origin story or sharing how our customers use Mapbox in compelling and new ways. Our brand and our stories are inextricably linked and we weave our narrative across all the pages of the website. We plan to migrate the blog back to the website to allow our content to be better connected with our products on the website. This move should improve SEO and directly increase traffic to the site by around 20%. We’ll also have better tracking for advertising ROI on these blog posts.","creator":{"login":"Gillinghammer","id":578328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODMyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/578328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer","html_url":"https://github.com/Gillinghammer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gillinghammer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2020-04-12T00:32:18Z","updated_at":"2020-04-12T00:32:18Z","due_on":"2019-12-15","closed_at":null,"start_on":"2019-08-08"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mapbox/www.mapbox.com-requests/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/mapbox/www.mapbox.com-requests/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mapbox/www.mapbox.com-requests/milestones/1/labels","id":5299624,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTI5OTYyNA==","number":1,"title":"WWW-01-Migrate off old React Pages","description":"We're heading into a new publishing paradigm at Mapbox and we need a faster way to publish content.
